This is a project that myself and a teammate worked on in our web development class. It's a website that hosts ingredients for people to add to their cart and "purchase", they can also comment on them if they are logged in.

NOTE: This was one of the first websites I worked on with multiple files, looking back I would organize the files into appropriate folders.
